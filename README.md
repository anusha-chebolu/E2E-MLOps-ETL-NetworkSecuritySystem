# Network Security System with MLOps Pipeline

A comprehensive end-to-end MLOps project that implements a Network Security System using machine learning for threat detection and analysis. This project demonstrates professional-grade software engineering practices, MLOps principles, and cloud integration.

## 🚀 Features

- **End-to-End MLOps Pipeline**: Complete workflow from data ingestion to model deployment
- **Automated ML Pipeline**: Automated data validation, transformation, and model training
- **Cloud Integration**: Ready for cloud deployment with infrastructure-as-code support
- **MLflow Integration**: Model tracking and experiment management
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI-based API for model inference and training
- **Modular Architecture**: Well-structured, maintainable codebase following best practices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- Scikit-learn
- MLflow
- DAGsHub
- AWS
- Docker
- Git

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Ingestion**: Handles data collection and preprocessing
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data quality and consistency
- **Data Transformation**: Feature engineering and data preparation
- **Model Training**: Automated model training with hyperparameter tuning
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for model inference
